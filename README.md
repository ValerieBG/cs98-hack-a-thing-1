# Learning Swift for iOS Development


## What you built? 

I explored iOS development by building two small apps in Xcode using Swift tutorials:

- GratefulMoments – a simple gratitude app that allows users to add, view, and manage gratitude entries with images. This project was for understanding basic Swift syntax, UI components, and work flow in an iOS app.
- FriendsFavoriteMovies – an app that works with data representing friends and movies, focused on working with data, lists, and navigation in Swift.
